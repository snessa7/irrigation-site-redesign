I need help with the irrigation-site-redesign project. Here's the current status:

1. **GitHub Repository**: Already created at https://github.com/snessa7/irrigation-site-redesign
2. **Code Status**: All code has been pushed to GitHub
3. **Project Location**: /Users/sethpaonessa/Desktop/LIVE/SimplifiedSystem/projects/irrigation-site-redesign/
4. **Deployment Target**: allproirrigationinc.netlify.app

The project is complete and ready for Netlify deployment. All that's needed is to connect the GitHub repository to Netlify.

Please read the CLAUDE.md file in the project directory for full context about what's been done and the current state of the project.

The netlify.toml has been updated to publish from the root directory (".") instead of "dist" since this is a static site without a build process.

What would you like to do next with this project?
