# All Pro Irrigation - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers deploying the All Pro Irrigation website from development to production. The site is optimized for Netlify hosting with form handling, redirects, and performance optimization.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Git (for version control)
- Node.js 16+ (for build tools)
- npm 8+ (package manager)

### Recommended Hosting
**Primary Recommendation: Netlify**
- Free SSL certificates
- Built-in form handling (perfect for contact forms)
- CDN with global edge locations
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Branch previews for testing

**Alternative: Vercel**
- Similar features to Netlify
- Excellent performance
- Good for React/Next.js if expanding later

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Opens browser to http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test Build Process
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve:dist
# Test production build locally
```

## Deployment to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Quick Start)
1. Run production build: `npm run deploy:build`
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag the `dist` folder to the deployment area
4. Site will be live instantly with random URL

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect GitHub account to Netlify
3. Select repository: `irrigation-site-redesign`
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run deploy:build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - **Node version:** 18
5. Deploy automatically on every commit

### Build Configuration
Create `netlify.toml` in project root:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run deploy:build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

## Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain Setup
1. **Purchase domain** (if not using allproirrigationinc.com)
2. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to Site Settings → Domain Management
   - Add custom domain: `allproirrigationinc.com`
   - Add `www.allproirrigationinc.com` as alias
3. **Configure DNS records:**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: [your-site].netlify.app
   ```
4. **SSL Certificate** will be auto-generated (may take up to 24 hours)

### Migrating from Old Site
1. **Test new site thoroughly** on staging URL
2. **Update DNS records** to point to Netlify
3. **Monitor** for 24-48 hours to ensure everything works
4. **Update Google My Business** with new website URL
5. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console

## Form Configuration

### Netlify Forms Setup
Forms are already configured with:
- `data-netlify="true"` attribute
- Honeypot spam protection
- Success redirect to `/thank-you`

### Form Notifications
1. Go to Site Settings → Forms
2. Add notification emails:
   - **To:** allproirrigation@gmail.com
   - **Subject:** New Quote Request from Website
3. Optional: Set up Slack/SMS notifications

### Spam Protection
- Honeypot field included (hidden from users)
- Consider adding reCAPTCHA if spam becomes an issue
- Netlify automatically filters obvious spam

## Analytics Setup

### Google Analytics 4
1. Create GA4 property for allproirrigationinc.com
2. Add tracking code to `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

### Goal Tracking
Set up conversion goals:
1. **Form Submissions** (Contact form completions)
2. **Phone Clicks** (Click-to-call tracking)
3. **Page Views** (Service pages)

### Google Search Console
1. Add property: allproirrigationinc.com
2. Verify ownership via DNS or file upload
3. Submit sitemap: `https://allproirrigationinc.com/sitemap.xml`
4. Monitor indexing and search performance

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization
```bash
npm run optimize:images
# Converts images to WebP format
# Compresses for faster loading
```

### CSS/JS Minification
```bash
npm run optimize:css
npm run optimize:js
# Minifies for production
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
npm run audit:lighthouse
# Generates lighthouse-report.html
# Target: 90+ performance score
```
