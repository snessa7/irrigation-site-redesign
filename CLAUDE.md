## Key Features
- **Modern Design**: Professional, responsive layout with smooth animations
- **Service Showcase**: Comprehensive irrigation services with detailed descriptions
- **Contact Integration**: Multiple contact methods including phone, email, and contact form
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags, structured data, and performance optimizations
- **Security Headers**: Configured via netlify.toml for production deployment
- **Image Optimization**: All images optimized for web performance

## Deployment Configuration
The site is configured for Netlify deployment with:
- **Domain**: allproirrigationinc.netlify.app
- **Build Command**: Not needed (static site, no build process required)
- **Publish Directory**: "." (root directory, as updated in netlify.toml)
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- **Caching Strategy**: Long-term caching for assets
- **Redirects**: HTTPS enforcement and 404 handling

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Netlify will auto-deploy from the main branch
3. The site will be available at allproirrigationinc.netlify.app

## Local Development
To run locally:
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start local server
./start-server.sh
# OR
npm start

# Stop server
./stop-server.sh
```

## Git Information
- **Remote**: https://github.com/snessa7/irrigation-site-redesign.git
- **Default Branch**: main
- **Latest Commit**: "feat: Add optimized images and server scripts"

## Important Notes
- All images have been extracted from the original site and optimized
- The site is fully static - no backend or database required
- Contact form submissions are handled via Netlify Forms (built-in feature)
- The project is complete and production-ready

## For Claude Desktop
When working on this project:
1. The GitHub repository is already created and all code is pushed
2. The site is ready for Netlify deployment - just needs to be connected
3. No build process is required - it's a static site
4. All dependencies are for local development only
5. The netlify.toml file has been updated to publish from root directory (".")
